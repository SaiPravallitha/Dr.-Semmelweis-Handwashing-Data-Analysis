# Project Title
## Semmelweis and Handwashing: A Data Analysis Journey
### Description
This project dives into the historical data collected by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis at the Vienna General Hospital in the mid-19th century. Dr. Semmelweis discovered the correlation between handwashing and the reduction of childbed fever, a deadly disease affecting women after childbirth. The project includes data analysis using Python and pandas, visualization with matplotlib, and statistical insights through bootstrap analysis.

### Data Import

Imported yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv and monthly_deaths.csv

### Proportion of Deaths

Calculated the proportion of deaths per number of births, focusing on Clinic 1.
Observed a consistently higher proportion of deaths in Clinic 1.

### Visualization

Plotted the yearly proportion of deaths at both Clinic 1 and Clinic 2, revealing a concerning pattern.

### Handwashing Initiative

Explored the introduction of handwashing as a measure to reduce mortality rates.
Analyzed monthly data to observe the impact of handwashing on the proportion of deaths.

### Graphical Representation

Created visualizations highlighting the period when handwashing became mandatory and its effect on reducing deaths.

### Quantifying the Impact

Calculated the difference in the mean monthly proportion of deaths before and after handwashing.
Determined a substantial reduction of around 8 percentage points.

### Bootstrap Analysis

Conducted a bootstrap analysis to estimate a 95% confidence interval for the reduction in deaths due to handwashing.

### Conclusion

Concluded that handwashing had a significant positive impact on reducing mortality rates, backed by statistical evidence.
Explored the historical context of Dr. Semmelweis's struggle to convince the medical community.

### Lessons Learned

Highlighted the importance of data analysis in historical medical contexts.
Demonstrated the power of statistical analysis and visualization in conveying findings.
